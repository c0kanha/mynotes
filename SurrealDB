SurrealDB is a next-generation, distributed, multi-model database designed to simplify the development of modern applications. It combines the features of both a traditional SQL database and a NoSQL database, offering flexible data storage for structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data. Here are some key features of SurrealDB:

Multi-Model: It supports both document and graph-based data models, allowing for versatile storage and querying capabilities.
SQL-like Query Language: SurrealDB uses a familiar SQL-like query language, but with additional features like graph traversal and dynamic fields.
Distributed and Scalable: It is designed to scale horizontally, meaning it can handle increasing loads by distributing data across multiple nodes.
Schema-Less and Schema-Full: It allows you to define schemas if needed but also supports schema-less structures for flexibility in data modeling.
Real-Time Queries: It includes real-time query capabilities, allowing data to be updated and queried in real-time without the need for explicit refreshes.
ACID Transactions: SurrealDB supports full ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions to ensure data integrity.
Built-in Authentication: SurrealDB has built-in user authentication and permissions, making it easier to handle security.
This database is particularly useful for applications that require complex data relationships, real-time processing, and scalability, such as social networks, IoT platforms, and analytics-driven applications.
